# Review and Track Your Achievements



Your Meeds solution supports the principle of transparency and for this purpose, it is possible to:

ðŸ‘‰ Review your achievements and track those that may have been rejected&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Cancel your own achievements if there's an error&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Track your progress and the granting of your badges&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Review the achievements of other community members



This way, you can:&#x20;

1. Know which programs you favor the most&#x20;
2. Understand how other members are acting&#x20;
3. Discover other actions to take new initiatives and earn new badges



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind**&#x20;

Any canceled action (deleting a message, for example) will be considered canceled in your list of achievements.
