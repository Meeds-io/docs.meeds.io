## About Meeds

Meeds wants to change the way we work.

Started in 2020 by several open-source software companies, the Meeds project was set up in Switzerland as a nonprofit association.

After sharing its vision in a white paper, Meeds is now working to make it a reality on web3 with the help of the Meeds DAO builder community.

The various committees of the Meeds DAO oversee the development of the open-source software that powers the Hubs and WoM.

They also manage the issuing and giving out of the â±®eed token, which has been officially recognized by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).
