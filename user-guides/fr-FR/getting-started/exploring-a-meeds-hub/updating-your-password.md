# Updating Your Password

You were invited to join your community on Meeds and you set up your first password.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ If you want to change it: go to your user settings

&#x20;ðŸ‘‰ If you've forgotten it: ask to reset it from the home page



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in Mind**&#x20;

When you log in, use your email address as your username. The email linked to your account is needed here. If you enter the wrong password a few times, your access will be blocked. You'll have to wait a while before you can try again.
