# Finding Your Way Around

The Meeds Hub has a flexible, easy-to-use, and up-to-date interface to explore.

Here's how to use the basic navigation:

ðŸ‘‰ At the top of the screen, you can find quick ways to search everything, check notifications, view your recently added favorites, and go to the Apps Center.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ On the left side of the screen, you'll find the main pages you can go to:

* Your profile, where you can make changes or update your details
* The Overview page, where you can join in challenges or see what you've done
* The Activity feed, to see what's new in your groups
* The spaces and people directories, where you can find other places and users to connect with
* Your settings, where you can make changes to your notifications and password

Some parts change based on what you're doing:&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ On the left side, you can find groups organized by what you've looked at recently.

&#x20;ðŸ‘‰ At the top, you can get to important apps based on where you are:

* On all the main pages, you can quickly go to the Overview, Contribution Center, and Shop.
* In each space, you can get to the apps for that space fast



**ðŸ’¡ Just so you know**: You can make the left-side menu stay open to work together better. You can pick which page you want to see first from the left-side menu.
