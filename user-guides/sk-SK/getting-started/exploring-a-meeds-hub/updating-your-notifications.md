# Updating Your Notifications

Meeds isn't just about helping you work together better. It also gives you apps that can help you plan a project, share and collect information and knowledge.



With so much happening, we have a way to help you sort out all the information. You can change your notifications to make them work best for you.



You can choose how to get notifications:&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Email notification: sent to the email linked to your account&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ On-site notification: shows up right on the site&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Unread activity notification: shows up when there's something new in your groups



You can turn them off completely or turn off certain types of notifications. With the settings, you can make changes that fit how you use Meeds. For example:&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ You can choose not to get any email notifications.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ You can get notified on the site only for reward payments or when a new product is added.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ You can choose to see notifications for activity only in the activity feed.



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in Mind**: Your administrator may have turned off some notifications by default, so you won't be able to turn them on.
