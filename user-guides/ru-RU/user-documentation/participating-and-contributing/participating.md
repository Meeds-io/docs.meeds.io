#### â€‹ðŸ‘‰ If actions are listed:

- Click on the action you're interested in to participate.
- If it's an automatically captured contribution, follow the instructions to [connect your profile](../customizing-your-profile/connecting-third-party-apps.md).

â€‹ðŸ’¡You can contribute even if you're not a member of the audience. These are known as _public_ actions. By participating, you automatically join the space.
