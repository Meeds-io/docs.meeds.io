# Setting up Notifications

### Specify the sender of notifications\&#x20

- From the administration site, go to the notification configuration
- Then, modify the sender's identity for notifications\&#x20
- You can change both the name and the address\&#x20

:warning: _Ensure to keep the same domain name in the email address suffix_\&#x20

### Allow notification channels\&#x20

You can allow or disallow the use of notifications for each channel.\&#x20

- Email notification\&#x20
- On-site notification\&#x20
- Notification for unread activity\&#x20

:bulb: For example, if you allow the use of email notifications, the user can choose to disable it if necessary.\&#x20

### Identify notifications by type, accessible to users\&#x20

- From the notification configuration\&#x20
- Specify for each notification type whether the user can activate or deactivate a particular notification channel\&#x20
- If you do not want to allow notifications at all for a type, you can disable the available channels. Then, this notification will not be offered to users.\&#x20

:bulb: Just like notification channels, each user can then [disable notifications at their convenience](../../user-documentation/exploring-a-meeds-hub/updating-your-notifications.md) or specify the channel to use.
