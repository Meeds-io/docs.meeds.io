# Managing a Public Site

### **Publishing Your Public Site:**

- Publishing your public site allows you to provide a personalized page to any non-connected visitor
- Showcasing your community\&#x20
- And listing your contribution programs.

### Customizing Your Public Site:

:point_right: **Before publishing, customize your site by adding:**

- An illustrative banner,\&#x20
- Useful links to external resources,\&#x20
- And a descriptive text about your community.

:point_right: **If your platform is** [**open**](specifying-access-to-the-platform.md)**, any 'public' program will be listed on your public site**

- A 'public' program is one with an open audience
- Either no identified space\&#x20
- Or a visible and open space

:point_right: **Preview Your Public Site:**

- Use the preview option to see how your site will look to visitors.\&#x20
- Incomplete content will not be displayed to visitors.

:point_right: **Making Your Site Public**

- Click on the eye icon to preview your site.
- Click on the lock icon; it will change to a globe, indicating that your site is now public and visible to everyone.

### Practical Informations

:point_right: **Delegate content management**\&#x20

- By identifying a user in the 'Web-contributors' group and assigning them the 'Publisher' role.\&#x20
- They can access and modify site content but cannot make the site public.

:point_right: **Your public site is also accessible to logged-in users.**\&#x20

- Any connected person can visit your public site, with a dedicated access to open the Hub.
