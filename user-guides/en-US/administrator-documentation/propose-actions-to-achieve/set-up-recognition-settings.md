# Set up Recognition Settings

### **Set the Number of Available Kudos**

* From the administration site, access the general configuration settings for recognition
* Edit the settings for Kudos
* By default, we recommend 3 kudos per week
* If necessary, modify the number and frequency

:bulb: **Reset to default values with a single click if needed**

### **Define the Initial Amount of Meeds for New Wallets**

* From the administration site, access the general configuration settings for recognition
* Edit the settings for Wallets
* Define the initial amount of Meeds to send to your users when they initialize their wallet

:white\_check\_mark: By default, we recommend automatically sending 1 Meed. The gas calculation transmitted with this initial send is calculated automatically.

* Modify the amount if necessary
* Add a message that will be transmitted to the users
* Confirm. Thus, when your users create their wallets, they will receive this initial amount

:bulb: **Reset to default values with a single click if needed**

:warning: _If a user deletes their wallet and initializes it again, they will not receive initial funds. In such a case, you can manually transmit these funds from the wallet management._

### **Identify Access and Management Rights for the Perkstore**

* From the administration site, access the general configuration settings for recognition
* Edit the settings for the Perkstore
* By default:

:white\_check\_mark: Everyone has access to the store

:white\_check\_mark: Only the administrator can manage the store, meaning managing products created by other users

:white\_check\_mark: Everyone can create a product, which also means modifying your product and managing orders

* If necessary, modify access by choosing users or groups

:bulb: **Reset to default values with a single click if needed.**
