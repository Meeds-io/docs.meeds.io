# ðŸ‘¥ Inviting Users & Guests

### :question: What are my options?

Depending on the [Platform Privacy](../../admin-guide/set-up-your-hub/specifying-access-to-the-platform.md), Space Admins have 2 options:

* The platform is **open**, visitors can freely sign up:&#x20;
  * Platform users can be invited
  * New users can be invited **by email**
* The platform is **restricted to only registered** users: Only Platform Users can be invited
* The platform is **restricted & external users can be invited** by space admins:
  * Platform users can be invited
  * New users can be invited **by email**. They will be considered "External"

### &#x20;:tools: How to invite users?

* Access the Members App and find the "Invite" button to start inviting people
* Access the [Roles Management](managing-space-roles.md), then click to Member List to start inviting people

Once you click to the "Invite" button, you will be invited to either invite members or send email invitations as explained above.

* You can invite people who have been previously invited&#x20;
* You can invite users who have previously requested to join your space
* Sending an invitation to an email matching an existing user is possible. The user will get notified as well.

### :bulb: Good to know

* You can add multiple email addresses using a comma between each email
* The invitation email contains a temporary token to create an account
* Pending Members are listed to help you check who has been invited and who has requested to join your space
