# üõ°Ô∏è Managing Space Roles

### :question: What are my options?

The usual for a space is to have Admins and Members. However, it is possible for admins to give specifice permissions to users thanks to 2 more roles.&#x20;

Here are the different roles available for Spaces Management

* Admin: Full control over space settings, customization, apps, members, and content.
* Publisher: Edit and publish space content such as articles, notes, text blocks, images and links.
* Redactor: Creates written posts, articles, and notes for the space.
* Member: Engages in space activities.

### :bulb: Good to know

* In Restricted Content Creation mode, only Redactors can add posts, articles, and notes.
* That means members cannot anymore write contents.
* Of course, admins and publishers can still add contents.
* If needed, you can remove the redactor role to publishers.&#x20;
* You cannot leave a space where you are the only admin.

### &#x20;:tools: How to promote users to roles / How to revoke them from roles?

From the Space Settings, access the roles page.

* Admins, Publishers and Members are defaultly listed.
* You can switch on the Restrited Content Creation mode to add redactors.

For each role, find listed users. Click to one of them to understand more the role and to manage users:

* You can promote members to the role
* You can revoke members from the role

**Note:** For member list, we suggest you to invite users to join your space from there.
