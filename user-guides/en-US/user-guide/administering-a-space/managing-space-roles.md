# 🛡️ Managing Space Roles

### :question: What are my options?



Here are the different roles available for spaces

* **Admin**: Full control over space settings, customization, apps, members, and content.
* **Publisher**: Edit and publish space content such as articles, notes, text blocks, images and links.
* **Content Writer:** Creates written posts, articles, and notes for the space.
* **Member**: Engages in space activities.

In most situations, spaces only need admins and members, but you can promote publishers and content writers  if you want to have more advanced control over how content is added to the space.

### :bulb: Good to know

* In _Restricted Content Creation_ mode, only content writers can add posts, articles, and notes.
* That means regular members cannot anymore write contents.
* Of course, admins and publishers can still add contents.
* If needed, you can remove the content writer role to publishers.&#x20;
* You cannot leave a space where you are the only admin.

### &#x20;:tools: How to promote or demote users from roles?

Go to the space Settings > Roles screen.

* Admins, publishers and members are listed.
* You can toggle the _Restrict Content Creation_ mode in order to activate the content writer role

For each role, find listed users. Click to one of them to understand more the role and to manage users:

* You can promote members to the role
* You can revoke members from the role

**Note:** For member list, we suggest you to invite users to join your space from there.
