# ðŸ“£ Showcasing your space

### :question: What are we talking about?

As a Space Admin, you can highlight your community to visitors before they join.

Enable a public site for your space and customize the featured content. From there, you'll be able to manage the visibility and layout of this standalone website.

&#x20;:bulb: **Note:** If you make your site public, non-registered visitors will be able to view it before joining the platform.

### &#x20;:tools: How does it work?

1. Access the settings of a space you administer. From there, you can decide to create the public site.
2. Once created, the website is only available to space admins to leave you some time to manage its content.
3. Edit the site, add contents and manage navigation if needed.

FYI, we have set a default layout for you so you can start showcasing your community in few seconds. Thus, following items are inheritated from your own settings

* Description of your space
* Admin list
* Member list
* Space Name

### :eye: How to manage visibility and access of the site?&#x20;

First, decide which user type can access your website. Depending on your choice, the access to the site will be updated.

| Visibility                       | Access                                            |

| Users excluding guests           | <p>Using a link<br>Before joining the space</p>   |
| Users and guests                 | <p>Using a link<br>Before joining the space</p>   |
