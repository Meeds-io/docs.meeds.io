# üôè Encouraging and congratulating

### :bulb: Meeds promotes mutual recognition and encouragement

üëâ You support taking initiatives:&#x20;

_The more you are thanked for your actions, the more you are likely to take on._

üëâ You value everyone's experiences and skills:&#x20;

_By highlighting your colleagues, you give them more visibility._

### :thinking: What does Meeds offer to develop mutual recognition?

Send Kudos to people you want to encourage, thank, or congratulate.&#x20;

* From a user's profile, send a kudos and choose where this message will be published&#x20;
* Whether by commenting on the message or a comment from the person you want to congratulate.
* When composing a message, choose to send a kudos, indicate the recipient, and select the audience.

### :bulb: Note: Send a kudos to a space

* You can also send a kudos to a space to cheer a whole team up.
* When sending a kudos to a space, the audience of the message is the space itself and cannot be changed
* You cannot send a kudos comment to a whole space. It has to be a kudos post.
* If the space is editorial and you are not a content writer, you cannot post kudos message there.

### :question: How many Kudos can I send?

* Your kudos has a value, so its usage is limited.&#x20;
* By default, you can send 5 per week.&#x20;
* Your Hub host may decide to allocate more and change the frequency (week, month, quarter, year).
