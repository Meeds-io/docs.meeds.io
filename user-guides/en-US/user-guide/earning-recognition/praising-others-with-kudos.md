# üôè Praising Others with Kudos

### :bulb: Meeds promotes mutual recognition and encouragement

üëâ You support taking initiatives:&#x20;

_The more you are thanked for your actions, the more you are likely to take on._

üëâ You value everyone's experiences and skills:&#x20;

_By highlighting your colleagues, you give them more visibility._

### :thinking: What does Meeds offer to develop mutual recognition?

Send Kudos to people you want to encourage, thank, or congratulate.&#x20;

* From a user's profile, send a Kudos and choose where this message will be published.&#x20;
* Whether by commenting on the message or a comment from the person you want to congratulate.
* When composing a message, choose to send a kudos, indicate the recipient, and select the audience.

### :bulb: Sending a Kudos to a space

You can also send a Kudos to a space to cheer a whole team up.

* When sending Kudos to a space, the target audience of the message is the space itself and cannot be changed. It means the Kudos will be posted on the space's Feed.
* You cannot send a kudos comment to a whole space. It has to be a kudos post.
* In editorial mode, only content writers will be allowed to post Kudos to the space
* Only the sending of Kudos to a space can be gamified.

### :question: How many Kudos can I send?

* Your Kudos has a value, so its usage is limited.&#x20;
* By default, you can send 5 per week (no matter if it is for a user or a space)
* Your Hub admins may allocate more and change the frequency (week, month, quarter, year).
