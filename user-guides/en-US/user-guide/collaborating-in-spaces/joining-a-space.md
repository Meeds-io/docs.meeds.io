# ðŸ‘‹ Joining a space

### :question: How to join a space?

* Access the space directory from the left menu.
* Find open communities that are freely accessible.
* Request to join communities. The animators can then respond to your request.
* Some spaces do not allow access and are simply listed for information.
* Some spaces are hidden and therefore not visible in the directory if you are not a member.
