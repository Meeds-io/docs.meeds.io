# ðŸ‘‹ Joining a space

### :question: How to join a space?

* Access the space directory from the left menu.
* Find open communities that are freely accessible.
* When the space public site is enabled, feel free to browse it before joining the community
* Spaces can be restricted to only members. Thus, those communities are only listed for information.
* Others are hidden and therefore not visible in the directory if you are not a member.
