# ðŸšª Joining a Hub

Once you've found your dream community and are ready to participate, you can sign up for the Hub.

Communities may have different policies regarding new members' applications. Some let anyone register, and others work only on invitations.&#x20;

The instructions below demonstrate how to enter a community hub with an open policy.

You can always log in with your email and password; if you use Metamask, you can use it to sign in instead.
