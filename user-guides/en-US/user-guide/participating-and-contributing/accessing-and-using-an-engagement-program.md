  topics and limit contributions according to the desired audience.

# ðŸ‘€ Viewing contributions programs

### :question:What are we talking about?

* Your Hub animator can organize actions based on themes,&#x20;
* And these themes can also target a specific audience.

ðŸ‘‰ Thus, a set of programs is proposed to you in the contribution center

* Each program includes a set of actions.&#x20;
* Some programs may be restricted to a space, meaning only members of that space can contribute to the proposed action

### :question:Where to find the programs?

* The dashboard lists the most recently updated programs.&#x20;
* You can also access the complete list of programs on the dedicated page.

### &#x20;:question:What does a program present?

#### :point\_right: For each program, find its specific characteristics:

* A general description explaining the expected objectives.
* The list of program owners.
* The audience for this program.

#### :point\_right: List of available actions and more.

* By default, only currently available actions are listed.&#x20;
* If needed, filter actions based on their status: completed, coming soon.

### :question: Who hosts the programs?

* If your program is associated with a space, the space hosts are automatically responsible.
* If your program is open to all members, reward administrators are responsible.

:bulb: Additional **program owners** can be appointed if needed to delegate the hosting of contributions.
