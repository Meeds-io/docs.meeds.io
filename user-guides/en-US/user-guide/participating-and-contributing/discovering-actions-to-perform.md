# Submitting your contributions

### :question: What are we talking about? <a href="#de-quoi-parlons-nous" id="de-quoi-parlons-nous"></a>

Your contributions can be submitted in two ways:

#### 👉 **Manually**

* When your organization promotes participation in an event,
* You can share your contribution by attaching an image of that event.&#x20;
* The contribution is thus submitted manually, and a comment can be added.

:warning: _Any manual contribution is considered "pending". That means program owners need to review it to consider it in the leaderboard and the rewards computing_

#### 👉 **Automatically**

* If you perform actions using Meeds or another integrated tool (GitHub, Twitter, etc.),&#x20;
* Provided your account is connected (see [connecting-your-apps](../connecting-your-apps/ "mention")),  your contribution is automatically captured and identified in the participation.

### ​❓How to contribute? <a href="#comment-contribuer" id="comment-contribuer"></a>

#### 👉 **Access the 'Actions' page:**

Discover recently proposed actions, actions no longer available soon, or upcoming actions.&#x20;

You can list actions by program for a thematic view.

#### 👉 **Access the program of your choice:**

Explore a contribution program, list the actions, and choose the action you want to participate in. Learn about the expected criteria.

#### 👉 Find featured actions

Discover featured actions from the dashboard or the general activity feed of a space.&#x20;

Display the actions you want to participate in as you prefer.

### ​❓**How do you submit your contribution manually?** <a href="#comment-soumettre-sa-contribution-manuellement" id="comment-soumettre-sa-contribution-manuellement"></a>

From an action, announce the completion of your contribution and share the elements according to the expected criteria.

_💡Cancel your contribution easily from the announcement message._

### ❓**How to participate with third-party tools?** <a href="#comment-participer-avec-des-outils-tiers" id="comment-participer-avec-des-outils-tiers"></a>

* Access your user settings,&#x20;
* Verify that you can access third-party tools and [connect your profile ](../connecting-your-apps/)if necessary.&#x20;
* Once you are a program member, your contributions will be **automatically captured**.
