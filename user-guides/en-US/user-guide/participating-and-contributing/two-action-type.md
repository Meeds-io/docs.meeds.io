# 🧐 Two action types

### :question: What are we talking about? <a href="#de-quoi-parlons-nous" id="de-quoi-parlons-nous"></a>

Your contributions can be submitted in two ways:

#### 👉 **Manually**

* When your organization promotes participation in an event,
* You can share your contribution by attaching an image of that event.&#x20;
* The contribution is thus submitted manually, and a comment can be added.

#### 👉 **Automatically**

* If you perform actions using Meeds or another integrated tool (GitHub, Twitter, etc.),&#x20;
* Provided your account is connected (see [linking-your-accounts](../setting-up-your-account/linking-your-accounts/ "mention")),  your contribution is automatically captured and identified in the participation.
