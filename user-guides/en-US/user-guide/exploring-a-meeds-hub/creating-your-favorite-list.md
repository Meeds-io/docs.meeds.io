# Creating your Favorite list

### :question:Want to bookmark a space or read a message later?

Mark the content that interests you as a favorite. This way, you can create a basket of useful content that's easy to find.

Here's how to do it:

* While viewing the content you want to save, click on the star icon.
* It will be added to your list of favorites, accessible from the top menu.
* You can easily find this favorite later using the unified search feature.
