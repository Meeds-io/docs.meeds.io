# üê¶ Growing your audience on X

Thanks to the X (Twitter) connector for Meeds, you can incentivize your community to boost your visibility on [X](https://x.com).

‚úã Before designing X incentives, configure the [X Connector](../integrations/x-twitter.md) on your Hub.

Once done, your program owners can select "_Twitter"_ from the _Applications_ pulldown when creating automatic actions.

Three events are available :

* **Like a Tweet:** is triggered when a user likes a particular post.&#x20;
* **Mention account**: is triggered when your account is mentioned (aka tagged).
* **Retweet a Tweet**: is triggered when a particular post is reposted



**üëâ Boost your reach**

You can ask your users to show some ‚ù§Ô∏è love to your posts by liking and resharing them.

Choose _Like a Tweet_ or _Retweet a Tweet_ and enter the link to the post to boost.

&#x20;To grab the link, Go to your X account and click on the timestamp of the post to boost :

Copy the URL from the browser address bar

Paste it into the _Tweet_ field :&#x20;

‚ö†Ô∏è if you see an error that says "_Please enter a TWitter link"_ after pasting the link try to replace 'x' with 'twitter' in the URL.



**üëâ Get more people to tag you**

For Mentions, if you have multiple X accounts configured to be watched (see [Connector configuration](../integrations/x-twitter.md)), you may be requested to choose which account the users must mention to complete the action.

üí° By combining these events you can design incentives for your community to engage with your X account

For example, in Meeds, translators could earn 2 points for every translation they made + 1 extra point if their translation was chosen, and 1 point for the proofreader.&#x20;

In parallel, users helping translate our Whitepaper specifically would earn 3 points per translation.
