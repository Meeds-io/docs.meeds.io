# Create Page Templates

* Only Administrators can create a template

### &#x20;:tools: How to edit templates?

* Access the Platform Settings
* Go to Development Entry from the Administration Menu
* Access to Templates > Pages

### :question: What are the options?

When creating / editing a template, you will be able to:

1. Create the Page Skeleton&#x20;
2. Update the Page Design
3. Add applications
4. Customize their styling & preferences
5. Preview the display for Mobile View

In addition, we let you update properties of the template:

:bulb: **The Preview is automatically generated once you save your template**

#### Creating a template from the Page Builder

You can also create a template from the Page Builder while adding a page.

This one will be listed in the Page Template Management.&#x20;

FYI, preferences applied to applications won't be saved here as it can be related to a dedicated context.
