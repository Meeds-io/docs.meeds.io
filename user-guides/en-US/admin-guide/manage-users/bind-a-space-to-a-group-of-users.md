# Bind a space to a group of users

#### :point\_right: Space Management&#x20;

Delegate space management to a user group by following [this procedure](manage-user-rights.md).

#### :point\_right: Link a Space to a User Group&#x20;

By linking a space to a user group, you ensure that users belong to spaces according to their profile.

* From the administration site, go to space management
* In the 'Manage Spaces' tab, find the desired space
* Under actions, click on the 'Users' icon
* A sidebar opens; add a user group by searching for it
* Once validated, a process will be initiated to link the users in this group to this space.

:bulb: **Result:**

* Any user who is a member of this user group will automatically become a member of the space.
* Users in this group cannot leave the space.
* However, as soon as a user is removed from the user group, they will be removed from the list of space members.
