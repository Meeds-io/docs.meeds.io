# Working Well with Your Community

Meeds lets you connect in a secure, simple, and efficient environment.



In fact, you can:&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Create a space for a dedicated, exclusive, or open audience&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Encourage exchange or collaboration&#x20;

* Share and discuss information on a topic to learn from each other&#x20;
* Work together on a project, keep track of the notes and actions, and consolidate reports



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in Mind**&#x20;

The leader can let certain people write messages and notes. Only these people will be allowed to write. A space can be open to all users by default. If needed, reach out to your administrator.
