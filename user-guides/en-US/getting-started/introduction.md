## About Meeds

Meeds aims to revolutionize the way we work.

Launched in 2020, by several open-source software vendors, the Meeds project has established itself in Switzerland as a non-profit association.

After publishing its vision in a white paper, Meeds is now working to realize it with web3 technology and with the help of the Meeds builders community.

Currently, the Meeds association oversees the development of the open-source software powering the Hubs and the WoM. It also regulates the issuance and allocation of the â±®eed token, for which it has obtained legal recognition from the Swiss market authority (FINMA). The Meeds association has the goal to build a DAO with Meeds stakeholders and progressively hand over governance and operations to the community.
