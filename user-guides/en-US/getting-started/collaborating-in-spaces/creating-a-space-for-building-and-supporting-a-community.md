# Creating a Space for Building and Supporting a Community

&#x20;Are you eager to build a community to:

ðŸ‘‰ Discuss a cross-cutting theme&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Get to know each other better, especially if you're working remotely in an area where other members are located&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Organize or follow a project with a small group of users



Then head to your directory of spaces to create your community. Here's what you can do:

&#x20;âœ… Name your community&#x20;

âœ… Describe its purpose&#x20;

âœ… Determine how visible the space will be in the directory&#x20;

âœ… Set the access rules: open, upon approval, or closed&#x20;

âœ… Customize the applications and the visuals&#x20;

âœ… Invite members and, if needed, promote them to moderators



ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind**&#x20;

The ability to create spaces may be limited. If needed, contact your administrator.&#x20;
