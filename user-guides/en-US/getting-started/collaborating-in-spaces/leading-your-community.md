# Leading Your Community

The Meeds solution not only encourages collaboration but also fosters engagement. Obviously, this requires leadership. As a community leader, it's important to:



ðŸ‘‰ Allow everyone to express themselves in your space&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Facilitate sharing and exchange of information&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Encourage reactions and initiatives from your members



Therefore, we recommend you to:&#x20;



âœ… Engage each new community member upon arrival to understand their interests and goals in joining&#x20;

âœ… Delegate moderation rights to decentralize power and enable new members to contribute to the community's vitality

âœ… Encourage exchanges by creating polls or engaging members on specific topics&#x20;

âœ… Thank and appreciate member initiatives by giving kudos&#x20;

âœ… Propose engaging activities through a program dedicated to your community&#x20;
