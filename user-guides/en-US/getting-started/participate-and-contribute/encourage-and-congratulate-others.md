# Encourage and Congratulate Others

Meeds promotes mutual recognition and peer encouragement.

ðŸ‘‰ This supports initiative-taking. The more you are thanked for your actions, the more you will do.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ It values everyone's experiences and skills. You highlight your colleagues and give them more visibility.



Use **Kudos** to thank, congratulate, or encourage the actions of other members of your community. They will thank you for this spotlight and recognition.



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind**&#x20;

* The number of Kudos is limited. So, it's necessary to wisely distribute these marks of recognition.&#x20;
* Kudos can be given as a main activity or in the form of a comment.&#x20;
* You can send Kudos to your network (only your contacts and the recipient will see it) or to a specific audience (by choosing a space).
