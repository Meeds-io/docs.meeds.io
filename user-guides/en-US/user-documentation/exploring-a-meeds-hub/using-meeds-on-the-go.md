# Using Meeds on the Go

You can get to Meeds from any web browser on different devices:

ðŸ‘‰ Tablet&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Mobile



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in Mind**&#x20;

You can do everything on Meeds from your mobile or tablet that you can do on a computer. Of course, everything is shown in a way that fits your screen.&#x20;



We're thinking about making a mobile app. Let us know if you'd like this and how it would be better than just using a web browser.
