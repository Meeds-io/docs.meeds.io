# Discovering Actions to Perform

Meeds offers a solution to **encourage community and team engagement** through several mechanisms:

ðŸ‘‰ Automated action gamification: **Any action performed within Meeds** or integrated tools is tracked and can be converted into points.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Declarative action gamification: **Take initiative**, announce your achievements to your community, and earn recognition.

ðŸ‘‰ **Build your reputation** by earning badges based on your actions and mutual recognition from your peers.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ **Rewards are given** in the form of tokens that you can use in an **internal store** or swap outside.



All of this is summarized on the first page, "Overview"&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ Here, you can see your progress and upcoming rewards calculated based on the actions taken during the week.&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ You can also learn about actions to be taken through the list of challenges and programs to solicit.&#x20;

* Most rewarding challenges&#x20;
* Programs offering the most points to earn



ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind**&#x20;

* Every week, the distribution of activities, the ranking (also known as leaderboard), and the number of kudos are reset.&#x20;
* The earnings presented on the "Overview" page are an estimate of your earnings based on the actions you take and others' participation. So, it varies according to overall activity.
