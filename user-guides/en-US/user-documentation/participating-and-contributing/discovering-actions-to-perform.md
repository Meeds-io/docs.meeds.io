# Submitting your contributions

### :question: What are we talking about? <a href="#de-quoi-parlons-nous" id="de-quoi-parlons-nous"></a>

Your contributions can be submitted in two ways:

#### 👉 **Manually**

* When your organization promotes participation in an event,
* You can share your contribution by attaching an image of that event.&#x20;
* The contribution is thus submitted manually, and a comment can be added.

:warning: _Any manual contribution is considered "pending". That means program owners need to review it to consider it in the leaderboard and the rewards computing_

#### 👉 **Automatically**

* If you perform actions using Meeds or another integrated tool (GitHub, Twitter, etc.),&#x20;
* your contribution is automatically captured and identified in the participations.

### ​❓How to contribute? <a href="#comment-contribuer" id="comment-contribuer"></a>

#### 👉 Find featured actions

From the dashboard or the general activity feed of a space, discover featured actions.&#x20;

Display the actions you want to participate in as you prefer.
