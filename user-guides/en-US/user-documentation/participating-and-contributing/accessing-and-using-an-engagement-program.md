# Accessing and Using an Engagement Program

With your Meeds, find **a contribution center dedicated to your profile**:

ðŸ‘‰ Here you will find **detailed programs** presenting the initiatives or actions to carry out (automatic or manual).&#x20;

ðŸ‘‰ These programs are offered to you because **you are part of their audience.** This means that you are members of the space identified as the audience, or all users have access to it.



**ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind**

&#x20;Some programs may be made available to everyone by default. Some actions in the program may have been disabled or have expired.
