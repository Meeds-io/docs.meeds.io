# Initializing your wallet

### :question:What are we talking about?

:point\_right: **Initialize your wallet to receive your rewards**

* Once you've initialized your wallet
* You'll receive rewards calculated for your contribution

:bulb: _If you don't initialize your wallet, you won't be able to receive your rewards_

### :question:How does it work?

:point\_right: **Go to the 'Wallet' page**

* Choose to create a Meeds wallet or connect an existing Metamask wallet
* If creating a Meeds wallet, you'll be prompted to save the private key

:warning: **Note: This is your wallet, and only you have access to this information. Keep this private key. It will be useful for accessing funds and managing your wallet**

:bulb: _For your information, transactions are conducted on the Polygon network, and the gas used for fees is Matic_
