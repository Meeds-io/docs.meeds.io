- The email includes a link to customize their password, valid for 24 hours.

:bulb: **Note**

- If necessary, resend the email by clicking on the envelope again.
- Once the user has joined the platform, it's not possible to resend this email.

:warning: To create an external user, invite them from a designated space. They will be automatically considered external.\&#x20

### Create Users in Bulk

#### :point_right:  **C**reate a .csv file with user details

- Import users in bulk by uploading the .csv file
